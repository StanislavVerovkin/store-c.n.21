            PRICES AND CURRENCIES
        </h6>
        <br>

        <p>
            Payments as well as refunds for shipments are all invoiced in Euro (EUR). At the beginning of each season, a
            fixed exchange rate is determined, and is used to determine the estimated price in the local currency.
            However,
            when the order is processed, the exchange rate used is the current exchange rate. For this reason, there may
            be
            a difference between the estimated cost, and the cost charged at the time of processing. Credit cards will
            be
            debited in Euro, and thus, due to exchange rates, the final price will be calculated in the applicable
            exchange
            rate the day the credit card company processes the transaction. When a refund is processed, the exchange
            rate
            used is that of the current day. This may also cause a variance in the price paid and the price refunded,
            due to
            fluctuating exchange rates.
